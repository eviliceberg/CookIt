CookIt is an app about recipes, created by evilicebergs on Swift using SwiftUI, Swift Packages, Google Firebase Services, etc.

Here I'll point out the main targets and requirements for this app(also I'll add a new ones and check completed):

1. Firebase Authentification(with Google, Email, Anonimous, Apple).
2. Firebase FireStore to store recipes and users.
3. Great UI/UX using SwiftUI and other frameworks.
4. MVVM Design Pattern.

New features coming soon!
